Today i was thinking that it was best to start writting down the direction that i wanted
the apis that i have written since they do not have an standard way of working they at 
least should agree on the way they behave and comunicate.

As a result of needing to stablish an standard on how i work with this apis i think is
best to write some of the common comunication styles that this apis uses 

File Managment: 
    on the file Managment pretty mutch all files handle by the api should be under wwwroot/
    no matter their funtionalitys if it is an static file it should be listed there , i also 
    will update the html location to be under either an html directory or an static 
    just for naming porpuses 


API TREE: 
    clownwire/
        fileName -> this one allow easy access to any file under -> clownwire/src/
        upload/
            upload/
        download/
            fileName
        src/
            fileName
        player/
        stream/
            fileName -> since it needs a file name 


Pending plans and implementations: 
    
    > Missing Implement an html front end to return a list of files
        > it would be cool to add the thubnails of the media files
        > there is a huge need for a songs data base with icons
    
    > Missing files resolver to get files either as temp or permanent
        > this requires a files database to list the files that are availables
        > directory for input and oupout based on random ids to do not couse issues
    
    > Missing the complete implementation of the Notepad
        > it requires javascript and html work 
        > the server side is not implemented at all 
        > requires database either file format or sql which i daubt i will do 
        > the notepad should have been just a single box with text to be saved with a label
